Project which prepares forward model based on our data and makes projections of sources (labels) to sensor space (using the forward model)

forward_model.py - this script extracst epochs, makes forward models (for each subject, condition, run and feedback separately) and averages
the forward models

make_bem.py - legacy form Vera, makes bem models
https://github.com/Mirrabella/probability_learning/blob/main/Sources/make_bem.py

project_src_to_sensor.py  takes forward model, simulates activity in predefined source space  (aka labels) and projects the labels
onto sensor space

functions.py - script containing functions which do the epoching and make forward moddel
